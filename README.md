In this project I had a target to make the prediction of user rating based on the review text, and see how the result can be explained with using different models. I have taken the most explainable models (Decesion Tree, and Logistic regression with L1 penalty which allows variable selection and so feature number reduction).

For the analysis, I'm going to take a dataset of reviews from Amazon in the directory "Amazon fashion", taken from the following resource: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html. This dataset represents the 3176 reviews of the Amazon users in the category "AMAZON FASHION" for the years from December 2009 to July 2018. The length of each review is from 1 to 1083 words. This is a reduced dataset, which contains only the products with at least 5 reviews in each.
